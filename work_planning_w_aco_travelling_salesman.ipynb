    "## Task Description:\n",
    "A small business needs to assign various tasks to employees in such a way that the distribution of working hours is optimized. The goal is the following:\n",
    "1. Minimize the working hours difference between employees (i.e., ensure an even workload).\n",
    "2. Certain tasks can only be completed by specific employees. It is advisable to create a task assignment structure where we specify who can perform what tasks, broken down by tasks.\n",
    "3. The maximum daily working time for employees is 8 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details:\n",
    "* Tasks: 10 tasks are given, each requiring different durations (in hours).\n",
    "  * tasks = [2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7, 3, 2, 4] # Duration of tasks (in hours)\n",
    "* Employees: 3 employees with different skills, so not all tasks can be completed by every employee.\n",
    "  * employees = [0, 1, 2] # 3 employees\n",
    "* Goal: Using the ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) algorithm, minimize the difference in working hours between the employee with the most hours and the employee with the least hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task Breakdown:\n",
    "1. Data initialization:\n",
    "  * List of tasks with their respective durations.\n",
    "  * List of employees to whom certain tasks can be assigned.\n",
    "  * A pheromone matrix that tracks the attractiveness of employee-task pairs.\n",
    "2. Transition probability calculation:\n",
    "  * The probability of assigning tasks to each employee is determined according to the ACO rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "P_{ij} = \\frac{\\tau_{ij}^\\alpha \\cdot \\eta_{ij}^\\beta}{\\sum_{k \\in S} \\tau_{ik}^\\alpha \\cdot \\eta_{ik}^\\beta}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- P_{ij}: Probability of transition from i to j.\n",
    "- \\tau_{ij}: Current pheromone level.\n",
    "- \\eta_{ij}: Heuristic information, which considers the remaining available working hours for the employee.\n",
    "- α,β: Weighting parameters that regulate the relative importance of pheromone and heuristic values.\n",
    "3. Path generation (solution creation):\n",
    "  * Each ant (iteration) tries to create a complete work schedule.\n",
    "4. Evaluation (fitness):\n",
    "  * The quality of the path is based on the working hours difference between employees.\n",
    "5. Pheromone update:\n",
    "  * Good solutions receive more pheromone, while less optimal solutions’ pheromones evaporate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of Task Breakdown:\n",
    "1. Initial population generation: Random work schedules are created.\n",
    "2. Evaluation: The work schedules are evaluated based on the difference in working hours.\n",
    "3. Modifications (search steps): New schedules are created using crossover and mutation.\n",
    "4. Pheromone update: Based on the results, though here we use a simpler GA (Genetic Algorithm) implementation from DEAP.\n",
    "5. Displaying the best result: The final schedule optimizes the balance of working hours between employees.\n"
